# Simulating Survival Time with a Weibull Distribution

This function is based on simulate_data in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsimsum/vignettes/relhaz.html

```{r}
#' Simulate survival times with censoring, based on a weibull baseline hazard
#'
#' This function simulates survival times with censoring, according to a weibull
#' baseline hazard that the user parameterizes. The survival/censoring times are 
#' simulated for user-given covariates and coefficients.
#' @param n how many survival/censoring time values to simulate
#' @param params parameters shape and scale for the baseline Weibull distribution, by default the exponential distribution with scale = 1
#' @param x x-values for the Cox model of survival times
#' @param betas coefficients for the Cox model of survival times
#' @return A vector of column names matching the keyword
#' @export
simulate_weibull <- function(n, params = list(shape = 1, scale = 1), x, betas) {
  
  # do dot product between x and the betas
  
}
```

<!-- Test rexp vs uniform transform -->

```{r}
nphm_hare <- readRDS("nphm_hare.rds")

# extracting the coefficients for basis functions 
# that do not correspond to knots and/or tensor products
betas <- nphm_hare$fcts[sdjflsjldkfjklsdlkf]

# extract unique list of coefficients selected 

```
